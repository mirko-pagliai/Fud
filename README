FUD


What is it?
-----------

FUD stands for Fuck U D... (guess what D means?).
It was written and it is actively developed in order to offer a free 
software alternative to proprietary software just like Dropbox, 
Box.Net, etc.
Users will be able to sync local folders to remote one via ftp or ssh 
protocol.
The only thing needed is an ssh or an ftp account even on a shared 
host!


The Latest Version
------------------

Details of the latest version can be found on the FUD project page 
under https://github.com/mirkop88/Fud/wiki.

- fudconf (user configuration script)
- fud.sample-conf (just an example of configuration file)
