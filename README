FUD


What is it?
-----------

Fud stands for "Fuck U D..." (guess what D means?).
It was written and it is actively developed in order to offer a free and 
open-source alternative to existing proprietary software just like Dropbox, 
Box.Net, etc.
Users will be able to backup and/or to synchronize local folders and files 
through a local or remote server, with ssh, ftp or other protocols.
The only thing needed is a server or an online space with ssh or ftp access, 
even on a domain or a shared host.
Enjoy!

How does Fud works?
-------------------

First of all, you need install Fud . You can do this using the `install` 
script launched with root privileges. 
After installation, just run 'fudconf', which will help you to configure Fud 
through interactive questions. For configuration, you can refer to the sample 
file fud.sample-conf.
When Fud is configured, it's ready to start. During configuration, you can set 
to launch Fud at startup. Otherwise, you can always run Fud from your terminal.
Please see the INSTALL file - which also contains information on configuring 
Fud - and the Wiki page of Fud 
(https://github.com/mirkop88/Fud/wiki/Get,-install-and-run-Fud).
