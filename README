FUD


What is it?
-----------

Fud stands for "Fuck U D..." (guess what D means?).
It was written and it is actively developed in order to offer a free and 
open-source alternative to existing proprietary software just like Dropbox, 
Box.Net, etc.
Users will be able to backup and/or to synchronize local folders and files 
through a local or remote server, with ssh, ftp or other protocols.
The only thing needed is a server or an online space with ssh or ftp access, 
even on a domain or a shared host.
Enjoy!

How does Fud works?
-------------------

First of all, you need install Fud. Just run the installer script with root
privileges:
$ su -c "./Fud/install"
Or:
$ su
[password]
# ./Fud/install

To configure Fud, simply run fudconf:
$ fudconf
Fudconf will help you to configure Fud through interactive questions. For the
configuration, you can refer to the sample file fud.sample-conf.

When Fud is finally configured, it's ready to run. During the
configuration, will be asked if you want to launch Fud at startup;
in any case, you can launch Fud from the terminal:
$ fud
