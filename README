FUD


What is it?
-----------

FUD stands for Fuck U D... (guess what D means?).
It was written and it is actively developed in order to offer a free software 
alternative to proprietary software just like Dropbox, Box.Net, etc.
Users will be able to backup and/or to sync local folders and files to remote 
one via ssh, ftp or other protocols.
The only thing needed is a ssh or ftp access on a server, even on a shared 
host.
Enjoy!
